observer
========

This is a Haskell implementation of the Observer design pattern [1,2],
providing a typeclass and two example implementations (sycnrhonous and
asynchronous), which are perfectly usable in their own right.

This package is based on Observable.hs by Bastiaan Heeren [3],
originally published as part of an exercise [4] for his students.  It
has been modified, extended and packaged by Andy Gimblett [5,6].

Changelog
